# MineCiv

## Introduction

Welcome to **MineCiv**! a Minecraft server plugin that lets players build, manage and expand their civilizations and cities. With this plugin, players can create cities, form alliances, declare wars, and engage in strategic gameplay to dominate the server. Whether you are a player who enjoys building grand cities or a strategist looking to conquer your enemies, **MineCiv** offers a rich and dynamic environment for all kinds of players!

**MineCiv** is in all a simulation of civilizations, where all of them, with no exceptions will rise, expand, have their Golden Age to finally come to an end. This will only depend on the capabilities of their leaders to still go for a longer time than expected.

This is a project that it's just starting, so be patient, because this will take some time to make, until it is available in all!
